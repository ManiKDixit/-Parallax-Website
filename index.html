        <h2>Know About the City </h2>
        <p>
            A little over 8 million people live in New York City. That means 1 in every 38 people in the United States call the city home.
More than 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. 4 in 10 households speak a language other than English.
Oysters were so popular in New York in the 19th century that the shells were used to pave Pearl Street. They were also used for lime for the masonry of the Trinity Church.
France gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States in 1886 for its centennial celebration. The statue was shipped as 350 pieces in 214 crates and took 4 months to assemble at its current home on Ellis Island.

        <h2>Central Park</h2>
        <p>
            Central Park, largest and most important public park in Manhattan, New York City. It occupies an area of 840 acres (340 hectares) and extends between 59th and 110th streets (about 2.5 miles [4 km]) and between Fifth and Eighth avenues (about 0.5 miles [0.8 km]). 
            It was one of the first American parks to be developed using landscape architecture techniques.
            The Metropolitan Museum of Art is in the park, facing Fifth Avenue. 
            There are also a zoo, an ice-skating rink, three small lakes, an open-air theatre, a band shell, many athletic playing fields and children’s playgrounds, several fountains, and hundreds of small monuments and plaques scattered through the area. There are also a police station, several blockhouses dating from the early 19th century, and “Cleopatra’s Needle” (an ancient Egyptian obelisk). The park has numerous footpaths and bicycle paths, and several roadways traverse it.

        <h2>About the City Streets</h2>
        <p>
            As one of the main north-south thoroughfares in Manhattan (and its oldest), Broadway's moniker may seem self-evident. However, the name is a translation from—you guessed it—the Dutch phrase brede weg, or "broad road."
             Fun fact: Broadway not only runs the length of Manhattan but continues through the Bronx and even 18 miles beyond the City, ending just past Sleepy Hollow, New York. 
             Along with Broadway, Wall Street is perhaps the best-known New York City thoroughfare.
              A metonym for the financial industry, the eight-block-long stretch in Lower Manhattan was originally named "de Waal Straat" by Manhattan's early Dutch settlers. 
              The most widely accepted explanation of the name is that it's derived from the wall built by Peter Stuyvesant, the last director-general of New Amsterdam, on the Dutch colony's northernmost border to keep out rival English settlers. (Stuyvesant also lends his name to a short stretch of street in Manhattan's East Village and an avenue in Brooklyn, along with many institutions across the City.) Another theory, however, is that Wall Street may be named for the 30 Walloon families, who were among the first European settlers of the island.
